    <p class="ti">Big Tobacco Push drives up per hectare production</p>
    <p id="op">Bangladesh's tobacco production per hectare has grown by nearly 21 percent over the last five years, indicating a hard push by big tobacco companies for more profit from a product known to be a serious health and environmental concern.In 2018-19, tobacco leaf production was recorded at 2.04 tonnes per hectare. It rose to 2.46 tonnes per hectare (20.58% increase) in 2022-23, according to Department of Agricultural Extension.</p>

<p id="po">This rise has been consistent too. Each of these five years saw an increase of about 1-14 percent, never recording a negative growth.Earlier in 2009-2010, per hectare production was 1.41 tonnes, according to World Bank data.This means, per hectare tobacco production has gone up by about 73 percent in the last 14 years. DAE officials, experts and farmers say this consistent gain in harvest is the result of the introduction of high-yielding varieties by tobacco companies and the application of high dose of chemical fertilisers and pesticides in tobacco farms. </p>

<br>
<p id="lo">"Tobacco plants require intensive use of fertilisers because they absorb more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium than other major food and cash cropsâ€¦. Many of these chemicals are so harmful to both the environment and farmers' health that they are banned in some countries," says a WHO report published in 2017.</p>
